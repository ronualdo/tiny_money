# TinyMoney

This gem only defines a tiny type object to represent money in a couple of systems
that I've being working on lately. The ideia is to centralize all the money
related code used on those systems in one single place.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tiny_money'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tiny_money

## Usage

TODO: Still need to write usage instructions here. But you can take a look at
the specs to get a feel.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then
run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file
to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
